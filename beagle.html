        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beagles are conveniently-sized, handsome and easy-to-groom, friendly with people, peaceful with other pets. And with their appealing soulful expression, it's perfectly natural that many people consider them as potentially wonderful pets. However, Beagles were developed as hunting hounds. They need much more exercise than most people give them, which is why you see so many fat Beagles. In addition, you can't leave them outside unmonitored, for Beagles are prone to wanderlust and can be adept climbers and diggers, i.e. escape artists. Also, Beagles left outside become bored and then they bay and howl and dig holes.
