    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basset Hounds are among the most pleasant-natured and easygoing of all breeds.
    Some are dignified, but most are clownish. Almost all are reliably good-natured, sociable, and peaceful with everyone – strangers, children, and other pets, too. At a dog show, one can count on seeing cheerfully wagging tails in the Basset Hound ring.
    However, this is not necessarily the easiest breed to live with or train! Many people are very surprised, when encountering a Basset Hound up close, at how bulky and heavy this breed really is. They may be short-legged, but Bassets weigh 50 or 60 pounds and need a moderate amount of daily exercise to stay fit, even if they appear to be content snoring in front of the fireplace. Lazy owners have fat Bassets with concurrent health problems.

            undesirable traits.
