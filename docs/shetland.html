    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proud and animated, the Shetland Sheepdog is a swift, light-footed runner and an agile, graceful jumper. Though on the small side, this breed has the heritage of an active herding dog and needs more exercise than many other smallish dogs. Exceptionally attentive and responsive, Shetland Sheepdogs are easy to train if you have a calm voice and a light hand on the leash. Sensitivity is one of the hallmarks of this breed. Often they need only verbal corrections, and they wilt or become defensive if you jerk them around. Praise, gentle guidance, and food rewards are the way to go with Shelties.

            undesirable traits.
