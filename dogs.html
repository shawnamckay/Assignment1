        <header> Dog Ownership: The Dilemma </header>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In an ideal world, I would have 101 dogs just like in the movie 101 Dalmations.
        However, life is cruel, sleep is necessary and my time is limited. So the unfortunate truth is
        that I must make a choice about which dog I am able to provide all the love and care it deserves.
        My narrowed down choices are: Shetland Sheepdog, Basset Hound and Beagle. This website details the
        pros and cons of each breed.
